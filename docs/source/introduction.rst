Introduction
============

Welcome to the Metagenomic Binning Practical Workshop! In this session, you will learn the fundamental steps involved in binning metagenomic data, from coverage analysis to binning, refinement, and evaluation. This hands-on workshop is designed to introduce you to essential tools and techniques used in metagenomic binning.

Metagenomic binning is a crucial step in metagenomics that involves clustering assembled sequences (contigs) into bins that represent individual genomes or species. This process allows us to reconstruct genomes from complex microbial communities, enabling us to study the diversity, functions, and interactions of microorganisms in various environments.

In this practical, you will:

- Analyze read coverage data to understand the abundance of contigs.
- Run multiple binning tools (**MetaDecoder**, **MetaBAT2**, and **SemiBin2**) to bin assembled contigs.
- Refine bins using **DAStool** to improve bin quality.
- Evaluate the binning results using **CheckM2** and **AMBER**.
- Interpret the results to gain insights into microbial community composition.

**Objectives:**

- Understand the importance of read coverage in metagenomic binning.
- Learn how to use different binning tools and their parameters.
- Explore methods for refining and evaluating binning results.
- Gain practical experience with tools commonly used in metagenomics research.
